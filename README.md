## Project Analysis

As part of your pre-work submission, please reflect on the app and answer the following questions below:

**Question 1:** "What are your reactions to the Android app development platform so far? Compare and contrast Android's approach to layouts and user interfaces in past platforms you've used."
 
**Answer:** [I've zero experience building Android Apps hence can't really comment on this. But as far as IDE is concerned, I have build several projects using eclipse, and I must say Android studio is better than eclipse.].

**Question 2:** "Take a moment to reflect on the `ArrayAdapter` used in your pre-work. How would you describe an adapter in this context and what is its function in Android? Why do you think the adapter is important? Explain the purpose of the `convertView` in the `getView` method of the `ArrayAdapter`."

**Answer:** [ArrayAdapter act as an interface between ArrayLists and List view. It binds contents from list view to ArrayList].

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

In EditItemActivity.java class, I didn't set up event listener on save button. As a result, the app kept on crashing on pressing the save button. In order to debug, I figure out impressive feature of Android studio's debugging mode which helped me zero down on the actual problem.
Initially, I thought, defining on click method would do the required functionality but still couldn't figure out the reason for app crashing. Setting up event listener helped me eliminate the proble
